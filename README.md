# RAIA Project

## Project Brief
### Problem Statement
Youth in Kenya lack direct access to air out their views directly to their leaders. This makes them forego their constitutional right to public participation in governance issues that have a direct bearing on their lives. There is, therefore, a need to create a platform that facilitates direct communication between citizens and leaders. With the advent of increased adoption of digital technologies by youth such as usage of smartphones and increased internet penetration, an opportunity exists to tap into the digital space to create a platform that facilitates connection between the citizens and the leaders.

### Objectives
- Develop a user-friendly online platform that facilitates direct communication between leaders and citizens in Kenya.
- Increase youth participation in governance processes by providing a platform for them to voice their opinions and concerns.
- Promote transparency and accountability by allowing leaders to respond directly to youth feedback and questions.
- Increase access to information about governance processes and decision-making, thereby empowering youth to make informed decisions.
- Foster a culture of collaboration and inclusivity by encouraging open dialogue between leaders and youth.
- Increase the overall engagement and interest of youth in governance issues.
- Establish a sustainable revenue model that will enable the platform to continue to operate and provide value to its users.
